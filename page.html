<h3>Friday, 2016-11-25</h3><h3>Saturday, 2016-11-26</h3><div><b>Name:</b> Ethical Hacking - The OWASP Juice Shop Challenge</div><div><b>Address:</b> 798 Washington Street</div><div><b>Time:</b> 02:45</div><details><summary><b>Description</b></summary><p><p>Help us hack a fake website! As web applications become increasingly common, keeping them secure is more important than ever. In order to defend against such attacks, you have to understand how they work, and what better way to learn than to see them in action? Join us as we attack the OWASP Juice Shop.</p> <p><b>Overview:</b></p> <p>After going over the scenario and concepts involved at a high level, we will create a running instance of this app and see how many vulnerabilities we can identify and exploit. We'll discuss the weaknesses we find and how to protect against them.</p> <p><b>Date &amp; Time:</b></p> <p>Saturday Nov. 26th</p> <p>2:45 PM - 4:45 PM</p> <p><b>Place:</b></p> <p>2nd Floor Program Room</p> <p><br/>Thayer Public Library</p> <p>798 Washington Street</p> <p>Braintree, MA</p> <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wNhK6LU5ZAL2"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wNhK6LU5ZAL2" class="linkified">https://goo.gl/maps/wNhK6LU5ZAL2</a></a></p> <p><br/><b>About the Event:</b></p> <p>You don't need to be a techie to get something out of this event! We will make the initial discussion of the topic accessible to anyone curious enough to stop by. As for tools, you really only need something with a web browser and a physical keyboard. It would be useful (but not required) to know a bit about dev tools. Here is a free interactive way to learn about them:</p> <p><a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/" class="linkified">http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/</a></p> <p><br/>For more advanced users, we recommend having Kali Linux or some other virtual machine installed on your system. As an alternative, you could use the free version of the Burp proxy from portswigger.net or any other similar proxy tool.</p> <p>Please do not look up any solutions to the challenge ahead of time (that ruins the fun!)</p> <p><b>Background:</b></p> <p><br/>In 2014, a group of volunteers built a highly insecure web app designed to support a fictional juice shop. They created the app as a tool for demonstrating important security vulnerabilities existing in actual websites.</p> <p>In 2016, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) began sponsoring the Juice Shop demo. OWASP is a nonprofit organization that maintains a list of the ten most important security flaws for web applications. The Juice Shop project illustrates the exploits that the organization wants to raise awareness about.</p> <p><b>Useful Links:</b></p> <p><a href="https://bkimminich.github.io/juice-shop/#/"><a href="https://bkimminich.github.io/juice-shop/#/" class="linkified">https://bkimminich.github.io/juice-shop/#/</a></a></p> <p><br/><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten" class="linkified">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten</a></p> <p><br/>&lt;a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project" class="linkified">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project</a></p></p></details><h3>Sunday, 2016-11-27</h3><h3>Monday, 2016-11-28</h3><h3>Tuesday, 2016-11-29</h3><div><b>Name:</b> Virtual Meetup: Hacking Explained and How to Safeguard Our Applications</div><div><b>Time:</b> 01:00</div><details><summary><b>Description</b></summary><p><p>Join NetCom Learning trainer, M.
